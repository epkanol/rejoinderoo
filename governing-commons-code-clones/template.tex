Dear Editor(s), \\

First of all, we would like to thank you and the reviewers for the time and effort that you have put into providing us with this detailed, valuable, and in-depth feedback, which (in our mind) helped us considerably strengthen the paper.

We have addressed all reviewer comments, and provide the details in this rejoinder.
In the updated submission, we have marked new, or substantially changed, sections in {{\color{blue}blue font}}.
To keep readability, we have refrained from marking removed paragraphs in a similar manner---they have simply been removed (but are of course visible by comparing PDF documents in tools such as Acrobat, or simple ``diff'' of the \TeX data).
We hope that this helps the reviewers to ``get up to speed'' with reviewing the revision.

We hope you find the new version of the manuscript to your satisfaction and look forward to any further feedback you may provide.
\\[3em]
Best regards,

Anders Sundelin
Javier Gonzalez-Huerta
Krzysztof Wnuk
Richard Torkar
